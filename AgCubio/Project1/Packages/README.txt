Server Problems:
1. Defines cube size as being too big, therefore, our resizing and drawing does not look optimal. We will need to fix the server code.

November 13, 2015:
Problems to still work on:
	1. Exiting gracefully when connection is lost
	2. Getting the correct mouse position in the resized screen when the cube has split
	3. Draw things on a scale that looks good.
	4. Status values (Implement a timer for refresh speed, smooth things over.) (FPS, mass, scoreboard, etc)
	5. Allow to retry connecting after a failed connection.
	6. Endgame scenario: provide some statistics, allow for player to play again
	7. Update only when the scene changes
	8. NETWORK: no reference to AgCubio
