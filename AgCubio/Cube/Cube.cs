        /*
        The Cube Class

The Cube class should represent a cube in the game logic. A Cube must at least represent the following data:
◦A unique id
◦The position in space (x,y)
◦A color
◦A name -- if this is a player cube
◦A mass
◦Food status (is this cube food or a player)

Note: it would be useful from an SE point of view to create other properties associated with your cube object, such as: 
Width, Top, Left, Right, Bottom. (As should be apparent, all of these are computed based on the mass and position.
